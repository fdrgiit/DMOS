#Client Server Application

The program needed to do the following things:
1. Three clients, one server.
2. Server contains a table, 10 entries. Each entry is a string.
3. Client 1 and client 2, add/delete or modify the strings, at random.
4. Client 3 prints out the table, sometimes.

The program was implemented using semaphores and mutexes.
